## triangle wgpu

Very simple but fairly complete WebGPU sample application, shows how to:

* create bind group layout
* create render pipeline
* setup vertex/index buffers
* use uniform buffer with dynamic offset
* setup depth buffer
* handle window resizes
* draw GUI ([Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui))
